O último evento detectado é marcado com um círculo laranja e ao seu lado podem ser apresentados alguns detalhes referentes, apenas, a esta última ocorrência.\\n      \")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"headline pb-1 pt-3\"\n  }, [_c('h2', [_vm._v(\"Sobre o Balcão Virtual\")])]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_vm._v(\"O Balcão Virtual foi desenvolvido em 2017 pela Coordenadoria de Inovação (CINOVA), parte da Secretaria de Tecnologia da Informação do Tribunal Regional Federal da 2ª Região, com a colaboração do Procurador Regional Substituto da Procuradoria Regional da Fazenda Nacional na 2ª Região, Dr. João Henrique Chauffaille Grognet.\")])])])])\n}]}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler?{\"id\":\"data-v-04c8d02c\"}!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/components/Sobre.vue\n// module id = 610\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;\n  return _c('transition', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"mode\": \"out-in\"\n    },\n    on: {\n      \"enter\": _vm.enter,\n      \"before-leave\": _vm.beforeLeave\n    }\n  }, [(_vm.localActive || !_vm.lazy) ? _c(_vm.tag, {\n    directives: [{\n      name: \"show\",\n      rawName: \"v-show\",\n      value: (_vm.localActive || _vm.lazy),\n      expression: \"localActive || lazy\"\n    }],\n    ref: \"panel\",\n    tag: \"component\",\n    class: ['tab-pane', {\n      show: _vm.show,\n      fade: _vm.fade,\n      disabled: _vm.disabled,\n      active: _vm.localActive\n    }],\n    attrs: {\n      \"id\": _vm.id || null,\n      \"role\": \"tabpanel\",\n      \"aria-hidden\": _vm.localActive ?
